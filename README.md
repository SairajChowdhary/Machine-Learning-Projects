# Spam-Mail Detection 
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to classify email messages as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham). By leveraging natural language processing techniques and a logistic regression model, we aim to build an effective spam filter.

# Features
Data loading and preprocessing of email messages.
Text vectorisation using TF-IDF.
Training a Logistic Regression model for classification.
Evaluating model performance using accuracy.
Function for predicting whether a new email is spam or not.
Visualisation of email category distribution.

# Frameworks and Libraries
Python: The core programming language.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: A powerful machine learning library used for:
train_test_split: Splitting data into training and testing sets.
TfidfVectorizer: Converting text data into numerical features.
LogisticRegression: The classification model used.
accuracy_score: Evaluating model accuracy.
Matplotlib: For creating static visualisations.
Seaborn: For enhancing visualisations.
matplotlib.animation: Used in an attempt to create animations (though direct display in Colab can be limited).
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is mail_data.csv, containing email messages labelled as 'spam' or 'ham'.

Metrics
Based on the current model training and evaluation:

# Accuracy on Training Data: ~96.7% (Based on your output: 0.9667938074938299)
# Accuracy on Test Data: ~97.1% (Based on your output: 0.9713004484304932)
These metrics indicate that the model performs well in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails on both the data it was trained on and unseen data.

# Potential Impact and Efficiency:
Implementing this project could bring significant efficiency improvements by automatically filtering out unwanted spam messages. Based on the dataset's distribution (~13.4% spam), the project has the potential to reduce the need for manual review of a substantial portion of incoming emails, saving time and improving user experience. The high accuracy suggests a low rate of misclassified emails, minimising the risk of important messages being marked as spam or vice versa.

Getting Started
Clone this repository.
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (listed in Frameworks and Libraries).
Place your mail_data.csv file in the appropriate directory (or update the code with the correct path).
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.

# Future Enhancements
Explore other text vectorisation techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Experiment with different classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Deep Learning models).
Implement more advanced preprocessing steps (e.g., stemming, lemmatisation).
Create a user interface for easier interaction with the model.
Deploy the model as a web service or integrate it into an email client.
